  "notes": "FrontierMath provides much better base rate than benchmarks that started at 30-50%. The 40x improvement from 1% to 40% suggests that starting at the 'foot' of the sigmoid doesn't necessarily mean slow progress - it can mean rapid acceleration once capabilities cross thresholds. User's intuition of 40% is now within the aggressive-but-plausible range."
